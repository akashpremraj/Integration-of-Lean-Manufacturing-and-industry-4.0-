# Mapping to Healthcare (NHS)

Value stream: referral → triage → appointment → procedure/test → discharge.

**Analogues**
- OEE → Theatre/Clinic utilisation
- SMED → Theatre/room changeover time
- FPY/Quality → First-time-right, DNAs/recalls, incident rates
- Energy/kWh per unit → Energy & CO₂e per procedure/test

**Pilot example**
- Sensors/timestamps: door usage, temperature, EPR events
- Dashboard: waiting time, FTFR, turnaround, backlog trend
- Governance: clinical safety, IG compliance, network segmentation, MFA, logging
