**Author:** Akash P Raj  
**Program:** Engineering Management (Project)  
**Duration:** **July 15, 2023 – August 31, 2023** (≈1.5 months)

---

## 📌 Overview
This project develops a practical **Smart Lean Manufacturing** framework that integrates **Lean** principles with **Industry 4.0** technologies for the **UK automotive sector**, consolidating literature, case insights, and an implementation roadmap toward **data-driven, connected, and adaptive** operations.

> **Goal:** Build and validate a phased framework that improves **productivity, quality, flexibility, and sustainability** while addressing **people, process, technology, and cybersecurity**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Assess Lean adoption, challenges, and opportunities in UK automotive.  
2. Map relevant Industry 4.0 technologies to Lean value streams.  
3. Design a phased implementation roadmap (assessment → pilots → scale).  
4. Define KPIs for validation (productivity, quality, cost, OEE, energy, lead time).  
5. Address human factors, training, and cybersecurity for safe adoption.

## 📈 KPIs (examples used in validation plan)
- **Productivity:** Throughput, cycle time, flow efficiency, OEE  
- **Quality:** First-pass yield, defects per million, rework rate  
- **Cost/Energy:** Conversion cost per unit, kWh/unit, maintenance cost  
- **Flexibility:** Changeover time, mix responsiveness  
- **Sustainability:** Energy intensity, scrap rate, CO₂e per unit  
- **People:** Training hours, ergonomics incidents, idea implementation rate

> See **Section 4.7.2 (KPIs and Metrics)** in the dissertation for context.
